//TODO: 

- for currentState == TURNED_OFF:
	- we canâ€™t just turn off and stay turned off forever. 
- logic for when to switch to the next state
	- ACTIONS TAKE MORE THAN A SECOND - closed loop vs open loop function calls
	- cycling? 

- David finish up waypoint code

- instead of turning off when out of full, maybe head for the shadow zone when right before running out of fuel

- write lookAtPOIFromOuter() and lookAtPOIFromInner() action functions


- finish, test, submit before 1:59 pm tomorrow.
